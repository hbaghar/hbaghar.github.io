# About me

👋 Welcome to my personal website! My name is Hriday, and I am a 🤖 data scientist with an MS in Data Science from the University of Washington and a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Vellore Institute of Technology. With a passion for using data to solve real-world problems, I have had the privilege of using data to solve interesting problems in 🏥 healthcare and 🌊 marine biology.

My expertise lies in machine learning and deep learning, statistical analysis, data wrangling and visualization, with a strong proficiency in programming languages such as SQL, Python, and R. I have worked with various tools such as 🚀 Databricks, 🌩️ AWS, ☁️ Azure, and 📊 Tableau.

In my free time I enjoy outdoor activities such as 🚴 biking, 🥾 hiking, 🎾 tennis, 🏸 badminton, 🏊 swimming, and playing around with 📟 microcontrollers and 🏠 home automation.

## Updates

I graduted from UW in March 2023 and had the pleasure of working with the Ocean Data Lab at UW on my capstone project titled "Classification of Distributed Acoutic Sensing Data".

We used deep learning and unsupervised learning methods to identify fin whale vocalizations in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Oregon. You can find the repository [here](https://github.com/Ocean-Data-Lab/das-finwhale-vocalization).

Here is a poster of the project that gives a broad overview of the work we did.
